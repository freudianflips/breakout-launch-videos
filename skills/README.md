# Skills

10 agent skills for Claude Code, Codex and other coding agents. `launch-film` is the entry point; the others are its tool manuals. `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` point to this folder, so agents discover them when you open the repo. `catalog.json` lists every skill's name and description.

| Order | Skill | Job |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | [launch-film](launch-film/SKILL.md) | Entry point. The hook plus body template, the core, the checks and the lessons. Start here. |
| 1 | [launch-brand](launch-brand/SKILL.md) | Your website into `brand/brand.json`: colours, fonts, logo, copy, screenshots and a preview sheet. |
| 2 | [launch-story](launch-story/SKILL.md) | Brief, story spine, script at the right length, beat sheet on the bar grid, storyboard, reference study. |
| 3 | [launch-voice](launch-voice/SKILL.md) | Cast a narrator, 1 take per line, fit the lines, align every word; free scratch voice. |
| 4 | [launch-score](launch-score/SKILL.md) | Music on the film's bar grid with the drop on the cut; free scratch bed. |
| 5 | [launch-world](launch-world/SKILL.md) | Backgrounds, plates, Blender glass and shader layers, when the film needs a world. |
| 6 | [launch-motion](launch-motion/SKILL.md) | Eases, continuity, camera, type, cursor and the signature moves. |
| 7 | [launch-sound](launch-sound/SKILL.md) | 1 consistent, key-locked sound palette and the SFX stem; free synthesised forge. |
| 8 | [launch-mix](launch-mix/SKILL.md) | Buses, ducking, logo drop-out, -14 LUFS master, laid onto the picture. |
| 9 | [launch-review](launch-review/SKILL.md) | Measure the render, the eye checklist, the gap list and the scorecard; study a reference film. |

In the voice-led template (`templates/voice-led/`), steps 5 to 8 run inside `videos/<name>/build.py` and `videos/<name>/audio.py`; you open those skills when you want to change how a beat looks or sounds.
